Teams are encouraged to explore AI-powered ideas that can make a real difference in education. These might include chatbots that quickly answer students’ doubts, recommendation systems that guide learners toward the right study materials, or adaptive platforms that adjust to each student’s pace and style of learning. The aim is to make education smarter, more efficient, and truly inclusive—so that every learner, regardless of their background, has equal opportunities to grow. By blending creativity with technology, participants have the chance to transform the learning experience, making it more engaging, personal, and meaningful for both students and teachers
